"""lnprototest: a framework and test suite for checking lightning spec protocol compliance.

This package is unusual, in that its main purpose is to carry the unit
tests, which can be run against a Lightning node implementation, using
an adapter called a 'Runner'.  Two runners are included: the
DummyRunner which is the default, and mainly useful to sanity check
the tests themselves, and clightning.Runner.

The documentation for the classes themselves should cover much of the
reference material, and the tutorial should get you started.
